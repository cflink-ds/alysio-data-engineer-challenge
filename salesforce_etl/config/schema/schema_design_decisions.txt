Normalization
    - the following tables: companies, contacts, opportunities, and activities are separate tables to avoid duplication
    - relationships between tables are established through foreign keys

Primary keys
    - each table uses the id column, which is unique, as the primary key to ensure each record is uniquely identified

Relationship between tables
    - The following tables are a 'One-to-Many' Relationship
        -- companies ---> contacts: A company can have multiple contacts
        -- companies ---> opportunities: A company can have multiple opportunities
        -- contacts ---> activities: A contact can have multiple activities.

Constraints
    - Unique Constraints
        -- companies.name and companies.domain: Prevent duplicate companies
        -- contacts.email and contacts.phone: Ensure unique contact details
    - Foreign Key Constraints
        -- Ensure referential integrity between related tables
        -- Example: Deleting a company or contact will cascade to delete associated opportunities

Indexes
    - Indexed Fields include:
        -- companies.id
        -- contacts.id
        -- opportunities.id
        -- activities.id
        -- all the above are automatically indexed as primary keys

Data Types
    - TEXT : used for fields like: name, domain, and email
    - BOOLEAN : used for binary fields like: is_customer
    - REAL : used for numeric fields like: annual_revenue and opportunity.value
    - DATETIME and DATE : used for timestamps and dates

Handling Missing Data
    - Nullable fields such as: phone, title, outcome will accomodate incomplete data without compromising the integrity of relationships
